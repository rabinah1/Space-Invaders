# Space-Invaders

## General information

This program is a simple shooter-game that I did as a free-time project. 

## Requirements for using the program

To start this game, you will need the SDL 2 -library. Specifically, you must be able to include the following files: "SDL.h", "SDL_ttf.h" and "SDL_image.h". These files should be located in /usr/include/SDL2. If they are located somewhere else in your machine, you must modify the makefile correspondingly. This program has been tested only in Linux-environment.

## How to start the program

In Linux, open the command line and navigate to the folder containing the files for this program. Now you can type "make" to compile the program. After that, type "./main" to start the game.
